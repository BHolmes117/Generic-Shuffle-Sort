# Generic-Shuffle-Sort
4/28/2020

This should tell you how using generics is similar to the regular sorting/shuffling.


When you start to use the program, you will want to make sure you have JDK.11 or JDK.8 when you this in eclipse.
Next after making sure you have it as the right JDK, you want to have yoyur class to whatever your name to be what you want, you want to have the ArrayList<?> then name your list or lists how ever many you want. Then you create your list of int and string, Do not forget that your ArrayList can be made with any object your using.


Then you write your list then for the method of shuffling your list, you can make it where you check the int of the object if it meets a certain length. For sorting you have it compare item in the list with ech other to see if one is larger than the other. That's is where the compareTo and comparable comes into play. The same thing can be said with the rectangle You do best creating your own and however many you want to shuffle and compare in your list. You would need to implement the rectangle into your other class for it t work fully. Also make sure to have the main mehtod in both classes.
